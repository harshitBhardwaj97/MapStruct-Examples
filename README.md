# MapStruct Examples Application

This project demonstrates the usage of MapStruct for mapping between Java objects.

## Introduction

[MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between
Java bean types,
based on a convention over configuration approach.
This project showcases how to create mappers for simple objects and more complex domain models.
